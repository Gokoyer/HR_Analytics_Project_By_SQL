# Human Resources (HR) Analytics in SQL

### In this project, I am going to collect and analyse Human Resource (HR) dataset in order to improve an organization's workforce performance. Some people also called this process Talent Analytics, People Analytics or Workforce Analytics.

#### The data wrangling and cleaning are carried using SQL. Then, data manipulation and data analysis will also be carry out by employing SQL. MS powerpoint will be used to create dashboard background while Tableau will be employed for the visualization

### Data Insights
#### This is my first HR Analytics project. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.
#### The overall Headcount is 311 before attrition is considered. A good business should aim for an attrition rate of 10% or lower. However, it is analysed that 33% of workers left the company either voluntarily or their job contracts were terminated due to various misconducts. There are 207 active workers while 104 workers left the company. Also, the average age of workforce is 44 years. Unsurprisingly, absenteeism counts recorded for female is more than that of their male counterparts by 30%.

#### Attrition by age category is analysed. Interestingly, the number of middle-age workers that left the company (61%) overtook that of adult workers (35%). Why significant number of experienced workers had to leave the company? What did the management do to retain them`?

#### The 3 Administrative assistants are the only ones that earn less than Production workers. The employees in this area (Production Technicians I and II) will create the most pain as well as having the greatest impact on the companyâ€™s image and success. It will be beneficial to retain them since they are far more(194) than the half of  the total head counts. Replacement cost can be expensive.

#### In addition, as a result of attrition, almost 7Million USD that was supposed to be paid as part of salary is saved. Nonetheless, there is need to know the replacement cost before conclusion should be made. 

#### Lastly, performance score is analysed, and Female workers exceeded and fully meet the performance score. Why male workers are performing relatively lower than their female colleagues?  Is it that some of the male workers need refresher courses and training due to the nature of their jobs? Are we considering those engaging in physically demanding and tedious jobs?
